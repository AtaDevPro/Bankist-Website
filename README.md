# Bankist Website 🏦💻

A modern single-page application built with **vanilla JavaScript**, demonstrating advanced DOM manipulation, smooth scrolling, tabbed components, lazy loading, modals, sliders, sticky navigation, and intersection observers.

This project is part of my **JavaScript learning journey**, inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s JavaScript course.
